Site + app for Rocket League ranks. Built fast, built clean, built to win.  
This isn’t some hobby tracker — it’s the future of rank analysis with AI integration.  

- Predicts and tracks Rocket League ranks in real time  
- Assigns weight to everything that actually matters (controller, monitor, connection, sleep, teammates, etc)  
- AI backend ready to make smarter calls than any spreadsheet or forum rant  
- Web app runs smooth on Vercel, Android wrapper for mobile play  
- Clean frontend in `sitefrontend/`, AI + payment logic separated in `monetize/`  

No fake modesty here. This is the best Rocket League rank tool you’ll ever see. Period.
